## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page


### Links
I deployed this completed challenge on Netlify:
- https://game-rps-shoot.netlify.app/

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
- Javascript


### What I learned
I decided to go through the Odin Project curriculum to improve my javascript skills e the challenge was to build a rock,paper, scissors game so I took inspiration from the frontendmentor.io website for the design and completed it.

### What should I focus on in the future to improve my skills (how can I become a better programmer)?
I would like to improve my logical thinking, writing better pseudo code and improve my ability to solve problems.
